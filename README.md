-: OBJECTIVE :-
<br>
<br>
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict flight delays based on various factors such as weather, time of day, airline, and airport congestion. By understanding delay patterns, this project aims to help airlines, passengers, and airport authorities make informed decisions.

-: DATA SOURCE :-
<br>
<br>
→ Download the Flight Delays Dataset from Kaggle (Bureau of Transportation Statistics).
<br> 
→ The dataset is in CSV format .
<br> 
→ The dataset includes fields such as FlightID, DepartureTime, ArrivalTime, DelayDuration, WeatherCondition, Airline, Airport, FlightType, etc.
<br> 
→ Use the dataset to analyze factors contributing to flight delays, including airline, airport, time of day, and weather conditions.<br>
→ Utilize the data to train machine learning models for predicting flight delays and analyzing contributing factors.<br>
