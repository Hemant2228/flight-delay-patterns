 OBJECTIVE :-<br> <br>
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict flight delays based on various factors such as weather, time of day, airline, and airport congestion. By understanding delay patterns, this project aims to help airlines, passengers, and airport authorities make informed decisions.<br> <br>

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE : Python <br> <br>
 LIBRARIES :- <br> <br>
→ Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. <br>
→ NumPy: For numerical computations. <br>
→ Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization. <br> <br>
 TOOLS :- <br> <br>
→ Git/GitHub: For version control and collaboration.<br>
→ Google Colab: For cloud-based computation.<br>
→ Excel/CSV viewer: For initial data exploration.<br> <br>
 DATA SOURCE :- <br> <br>
→ Download the Flight Delays Dataset from Kaggle (Bureau of Transportation Statistics).
<br> 
→ The dataset is in CSV format .
<br> 
→ The dataset includes fields such as FlightID, DepartureTime, ArrivalTime, DelayDuration, WeatherCondition, Airline, Airport, FlightType, etc.
<br> 
→ Use the dataset to analyze factors contributing to flight delays, including airline, airport, time of day, and weather conditions.<br>
→ Utilize the data to train machine learning models for predicting flight delays and analyzing contributing factors.<br> <br>
EXECUTION STEPS :-<br> <br>
→ Clone or download the project repository.<br>
→ Install required tools and libraries.<br>
→ Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder.<br>
→ Preprocess the dataset to clean and organize data.<br>
→ Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends.<br>
→ Visualize data insights using graphs and charts.<br>
→ Train the machine learning model using the prepared dataset.<br>
→ Evaluate the model’s performance on test data.<br>
→ Deploy the project (if applicable) for user interaction.<br>
→ Document results and prepare for final presentation.<br> <br>
SUMMARY :-<br> <br>
Analysis:<br>→ Key factors affecting delays include weather conditions, departure time, and airline performance.<br>
Model Performance:<br>
→ Achieved X% accuracy with [specific ML model]<br>
→ Reduced prediction error to Y minutes<br>
Insights:<br>→  Flights during peak hours and specific seasons are more prone to delays.<br> <br>
